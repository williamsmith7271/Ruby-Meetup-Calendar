# Events Calender

We can pull in data from meetup from URLs:

 - https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/events/json/
 - https://api.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Melbourne/events?status=past - Also if we want to backlog some event data

Eventbrite I think needs an API token, but we can use:

 - https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/organizations/28936506513/events/
